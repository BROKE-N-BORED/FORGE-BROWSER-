"""Forge Browser — a standalone AI browser program.

Built at Joshua's order (2026-11-11): a browser program with its
own window that runs STANDALONE — its own folder, no Code Forge
required. The same engine room is also wired into Code Forge as a
tool, but this project stands on its own.
It uses NO other company's API key, no account, and no paid service
anywhere in the chain, search included. Plain Python standard
library only, so it runs anywhere Python 3 does and carries no
dependency risk into whatever project adopts it later.

What it does:

* ``search(query)`` — keyless web search (local SearXNG when
  configured, else a DuckDuckGo Lite/HTML + Bing fallback chain).
* ``fetch(url)`` — one page in, clean Markdown out, paged for small
  context windows. ``fetch_any(url)`` — any file type: PDF text,
  images, audio, video, JSON/CSV/text, binaries saved with a report.
* ``render(url)`` / ``snapshot(url)`` / ``screenshot(...)`` — a local
  browser engine over CDP (Chromium, or Lightpanda serving): the
  page after JavaScript, its accessibility snapshot with numbered
  interactive elements, real screenshots.
* Multimodal seats (media.py) — a local Ollama vision seat describes
  images into text; local whisper backends transcribe audio. Media
  is turned into text by a seat, never attached to a model that
  cannot parse it, and never described by invention when no seat
  exists.
* Barriers (barriers.py) — cookie/consent banners are dismissed by
  their own buttons; CAPTCHA / human checks and unknown logins are
  detected and handed to the person on a persistent profile, so one
  human minute makes later visits seamless.
* The vault (vault.py) — site passwords and account details in one
  encrypted file (passphrase key, encrypt-then-MAC, 0600). Logins
  are filled into pages without the values ever reaching a model's
  context or a log.
* ``verify_in_browser(target, workspace)`` — the #65 contract on
  this engine: project pages served throwaway on 127.0.0.1, text
  back, screenshot saved under .forge/artifacts/.
* Research (research.py) — plan gate first, then the search/read
  loop, then a cited Markdown report of what the sources said.

Fences: http(s) only for fetching; the CDP engine is a local process
on 127.0.0.1; requests carry no keys, cookies, or telemetry; secrets
live only in the vault and in the memory of the process using them.
